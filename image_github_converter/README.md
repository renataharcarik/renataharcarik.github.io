# The Markdown to HTML Image Converter
is a simple app I created to help me reduce image size of images uploaded to Github. As a front-end developer I regularly use
a before and after approach to showcase my changes. As a former tech-writer I also want to keep the github issues clean and concise as much as
possible. Pasting an image to github directly sometimes results in gigantic images splattered over the whole screen. To make the process of making
the images smaller easier, I created this app.

How to use:
- paste the raw github image link/s
- set desired width in pixels
- press Convert to generate html format with the desired image size
- on the right-bottom you have a small icon to copy the created format
- first option generates images, where each image is in one separate line
- second option creates a two-column table with the images
